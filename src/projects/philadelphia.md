Macro Sea renovated three neglected industrial buildings in northern Philadelphia into a hive of creativity for the surrounding community. The approximately 27,000 square foot building combined a gallery, offices, art studios, classrooms, and coworking space, as well as a restaurant. To preserve the unique character of each of the buildings, we restored the historic facade and plaster ceiling medallion of the church, sandblasted the hardwood floors and brick of the warehouse, and clear-coated most of the existing walls exactly as they were. Throughout the building, one catches glimpses of the building’s former lives – the shadow of a stair climbing up a wall, the machinery from the old freight elevator hanging in the lobby, a few remaining scraps of ornate wallpaper in the former church. The space is now used as a coworking facility – creating a true hub for freelancers in Northern Liberties.
