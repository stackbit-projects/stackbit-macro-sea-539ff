In collaboration with our partners, Macro Sea strategically assembled 6 properties in Queens, New York to develop a ground-up student housing and academic facility in a market with a severe shortage in student housing. Macro sea and DBI leased the 480 bed dormitory to a private American university and delivered the facility to students within 2.5 years of project conception.
