Macro Sea worked with DBI on an adaptive reuse project to create a new home for an American university. Macro Sea and DBI converted a historical, but physically deteriorating building into educational and dormitory facilities for American students studying abroad. New life was brought to a gorgeous property, and the current owners live side-by-side with their new American neighbors.
